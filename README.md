Aim of the Project:
The goal of this project is to classify breast ultrasound images as either normal/benign or malignant using two models: a GoogLeNet-inspired Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a custom-designed CNN. The process will involve loading and preprocessing the dataset, building both CNN models, and then evaluating their performance.

About the Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is BreastMNIST, sourced from the MedMNIST2D dataset collection. BreastMNIST consists of breast ultrasound images aimed at identifying abnormalities. While the original dataset categorizes images into three classes—normal, benign, and malignant—due to the low resolution of the images, it has been simplified into a binary classification problem. In this version, normal and benign cases are grouped together as "Normal/Benign," while malignant cases are labeled as "Malignant."
